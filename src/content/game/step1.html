  <h2><span>First step:</span> Understand Dumpfun.io</h2>
  <p>Dumpfun is a memecoin launchpad where the rules of the game have been completely rewritten.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Every token starts its life behind a lock—a ticking clock that forces everyone to hold.</p>
  <p>Buy all you want, build your stack, but remember: the sell button doesn't exist yet.</p>
  <p>When time runs out, the gates open. The lock breaks, and the "dump" begins as everyone races for the exit at the exact same moment.</p>
  <br />
  <p>It sounds like pure chaos and it is. <br />But that’s exactly why it works.</p>
